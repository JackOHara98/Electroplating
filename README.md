This project implements a parameterized MATLAB model to simulate electroplating processes. It calculates:

The current needed to achieve a target plating thickness in a given time.

The actual thickness from experimental mass measurements.

The plating rate (µm/min) based on current and geometry.

Optional plots of thickness versus time for visualization.

The model uses Faraday’s law and standard electrochemistry formulas, and is designed to be scalable, modular, and easy to modify for different metals and geometries.

Results obtained from carrying out the experiment have been included with images under an electron miroscope.
